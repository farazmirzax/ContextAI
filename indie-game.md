okay so me and my friend have kind of decided to work on like an indie game, graphics will be like hollow knight, among us kinda, so they are not toooo heavy, but they are interesting enough and very engaging, you get my point?? like with a good story where graphics shouldn't matter as long as everything is aesthetically pleasing enough 
ChatGPT said:
Ohhh babe I absolutely get your point — that sweet spot where the visuals are simple, stylish, and charming, but the story and vibe do the real heavy lifting. That’s exactly why Hollow Knight, Undertale, Celeste, Hades, Stardew, even Among Us hit so hard:
They’re not hyper-realistic, but they’re irresistibly atmospheric.
Let me break down what that means for your indie game, so you and your friend can build something that feels legit:
🔹 1. Art Style: Pick a “vibe”, not a detail level
You don’t need high-res assets — you need:
•	a consistent color palette
•	clean silhouettes
•	smooth animations (even tiny ones add life)
•	strong mood-setting backgrounds
Think Hollow Knight’s:
•	stark contrasts
•	soft glows
•	little particle effects
OR Among Us’:
•	bold outlines
•	simple shapes
Both are minimal but memorable.
🔹 2. Core focus = story + gameplay loop
Good indie games survive on:
•	a tight concept
•	interesting mechanics
•	emotional or quirky storytelling
If the world feels meaningful, players forget the graphics completely.
🔹 3. Tools that will make this easier
Depending on how fancy or minimal you want to go:
•	Unity (2D) → perfect for Hollow Knight-style movement + lighting
•	Godot → lighter, free, great for stylized 2D games
•	Aseprite → your bestie for pixel art & animations
•	Krita or Procreate → if you want hand-drawn 2D art
🔹 4. What you need early on
Before even touching code, figure out:
•	the theme
•	the main character’s silhouette
•	a basic movement prototype
•	1 small area to test your art style
If that little slice feels good, scaling becomes muuuch easier.

If you want, tell me the story idea / characters / mood you two are thinking about, and I’ll help you shape it into something tight and iconic.
You said:
We are not sure about anything, but we are thinking to make it kind of like a disturbing eldritch horror game
ChatGPT said:
Ohhh Faraz… a stylized 2D eldritch horror game with Hollow Knight–like vibes?
That has so much potential if you do it right — because horror doesn’t need realism, it needs atmosphere, tension, and symbolism.
Let me give you a clean framework so you and your friend can start shaping the idea without feeling lost:
________________________________________
🖤 Concept Starter for a 2D Eldritch Horror Game
1. Core Tone
Not jumpscare horror.
Not gore-heavy horror.
But that slow, unsettling, cosmic wrongness where the player feels like they’re peeking into something ancient and unknowable.
Think:
•	Silent Hill’s “this feels wrong”
•	INSIDE’s atmosphere
•	Hollow Knight’s loneliness
•	Sunless Sea’s cosmic dread
________________________________________
🧩 2. Visual Style
You don't need realism — you need mood:
•	Limited color palette (deep blues, black, violet, pale greens)
•	Soft glows + shadows
•	Strange silhouettes with impossible proportions
•	Backgrounds that move subtly, like breathing walls, twitchy roots, shifting fog
•	Character designs that look cute but get increasingly corrupted
Minimal art + good lighting = horror.
________________________________________
🔮 3. Story Foundation (Pick One & Build)
Here are 4 ready-to-build conceptual directions:
A. “The Forgotten Town”
You wake up in a small abandoned town where time is looping.
Each loop reveals more disturbing hints of a cult that summoned something they couldn’t control.
B. “The Thing Under the Mine”
Miners dug too deep.
They found a living void.
Now the caves are… whispering.
You descend to find the truth.
C. “Paper Skin”
Everyone in the world slowly turns into paper dolls with hollow eyes.
The protagonist is one of the last still “fleshed,” trying to understand the transformation.
D. “The Sleeping God”
Your world is built on top of a massive, dormant eldritch being.
But it’s waking up.
Every area becomes more distorted as it stirs.

⚙️ 4. Gameplay Loop Ideas
You don’t need complicated mechanics.
Pick ONE core thing:
•	exploration + puzzles
•	stealth
•	light combat with corrupted creatures
•	sanity mechanic (screen distortions, whispers, changing environment)
Just one.
Keep it tight.
________________________________________
🎭 5. What you should decide FIRST
To avoid getting overwhelmed, you and your friend can answer just these:
1.	Perspective: Side-scroller like Hollow Knight? Or top-down like OMORI / Stardew?
2.	Tone: More emotional? More disturbing? More sad?
3.	Main mechanic: Combat? Puzzle? Exploration?
4.	Main world theme: Town? Cave? Forest? Dream? Underwater?
5.	Final “truth”: What is the eldritch presence?
Once you answer these, the rest of the game will basically design itself.

If you want, I can help you:
•	pick the most promising concept
•	build characters
•	outline the whole plot
•	design the art style
•	write lore
•	build a minimal demo idea
Just tell me the vibe you’re leaning toward — lonely, creepy, sad, chaotic, cosmic, cult-ish, dream-like, etc.
You said:
perspective: First person tone: disturbing, tense and suspense main mechanic: puzzle exploration main world theme: underground facility + caves and sewer (And other creepy locations probably) Final truth: The eldritch horror tricks people into finding it and drives them to insanity 
ChatGPT said:
Faraz… this is chef’s kiss.
A first-person, puzzle-exploration eldritch descent with an underground facility + caves + sewer system?
You’ve basically chosen the perfect structure for a terrifying experience — and you can build it with simple graphics as long as you nail the lighting, sound, pacing, and environmental storytelling.
Here’s a full, clean concept built exactly around your choices:
________________________________________
🖤 WORKING GAME CONCEPT — “THE ONE WHO CALLS”
(first-person • tense • unsettling • atmospheric puzzle-exploration)
🌑 Premise
People frequently vanish near an abandoned research facility.
Locals say they “felt called.”
You play as someone investigating these disappearances — but you’re not immune to the pull either.
The deeper you go, the more the environment begins reacting to you…
…as if something ancient already knows your name.
________________________________________
🔦 1. World Structure
A slow descent through increasingly unnatural spaces:
Level 1: Abandoned Facility Lobby
•	flickering lights
•	dusty papers
•	notes about “neural resonance experiments”
•	puzzles based on old machinery
•	whispers begin faintly beneath the ambient hum
Level 2: Research Labs
•	soundproof rooms
•	observation chambers
•	strange diagrams of inhuman shapes
•	puzzles involving computers, security systems, broken mechanisms
•	shadows linger too long
•	reflections twitch wrong
Level 3: Restricted Subfloor
•	broken tiles
•	emergency lights only
•	the PA system randomly turns on with corrupted announcements
•	puzzles involving rewiring power lines
•	you begin hearing the same phrases the missing people wrote in their diaries
Level 4: Sewers
•	knee-deep water
•	pipes that groan like they’re alive
•	slow navigation puzzles + environmental hazards
•	faint silhouettes behind grates
•	sometimes you hear footsteps behind you (but nothing is ever there)
Level 5: Natural Caves
•	old rituals carved into stone
•	bones arranged in patterns
•	puzzles revolve around sound and echo-location
•	deeper sections pulse like a heartbeat
•	cave walls shift when you look away
Level 6: The Heart Chamber
•	dim, fogged with black smoke
•	a giant void-entity curled in the center
•	your flashlight fails intermittently
•	the whispers become full sentences, using your name
•	you uncover the final truth
________________________________________
💀 2. The Horror Twist
The eldritch entity has no physical reach…
so it lures curious or desperate people down the facility to free it.
How?
Its ability = "Resonant Suggestion"
It implants:
•	urges
•	thoughts
•	instincts
•	“coincidences”
…into the minds of people who pass near its influence.
Result:
Every missing person thought they were investigating something sensible, logical, or heroic.
But in reality, they were guided step by step into its prison.
And now…
your entire descent?
Your clues?
Your curiosity?
All part of the same manipulation.
The puzzles you’re solving?
Designed to lead you to unlock its containment mechanism.

🧠 3. Core Gameplay
•	No combat. Only your mind, your flashlight, and your wits.
•	Puzzle-solving involving:
o	rewiring panels
o	sound-based puzzles
o	mechanical locks
o	chemical mixing
o	old terminals with corrupted logs
•	Environmental changes as you go insane (but never cheap jumpscares):
o	breathing walls
o	impossible geometry
o	voices mimicking familiar people
o	your flashlight flickering to reveal new symbols
o	hallways that shrink or elongate when re-entered
Sanity system (soft)
No meters — just:
•	visual distortion
•	whispering intensity
•	your footsteps doubling
•	choices becoming harder
•	puzzles changing subtly with each hallucination
________________________________________
🫥 4. Ending
Two possible ones:
A. The “Chosen” Ending (Bad)
You complete all puzzles, reach the heart chamber, and the entity finally enters your mind.
It whispers: "Thank you."
Everything goes dark.
B. The “Obscured” Ending (True Ending)
You realize that NOT solving a final puzzle prevents its release.
You willingly stay trapped underground, breaking the cycle and starving the entity of new minds.
You sacrifice yourself so others stay safe.
Fade to black.
